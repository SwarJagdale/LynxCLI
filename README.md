# LynxCLI
LynuxCLI is a command-line interface (CLI) script designed to interact with the Gemini API, leveraging the power of the Google Cloud Platform's language model. The script allows users to input prompts and receive human-like responses generated by the Gemini language model.

## Prerequisites

Before using LynuxCLI, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **Bash Shell**: Most Unix-based systems come with Bash pre-installed. On Windows, you can use tools like Git Bash or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

- **jq**: Install using your system's package manager. For example:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install jq  # Debian/Ubuntu
- **API Key**: Replace "YOUR_API_KEY with your own Google API. You can get your own api key at https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
